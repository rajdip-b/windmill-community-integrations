# Pushover Integration

## Environment variables and credentials setup

To get started, create an account on [Pushover](https://pushover.net/). Next, follow the steps to obtain the keys.

- `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY`: User key from Pushover. This can be found from the dashboard.
- `PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN`: API token from Pushover. You will need to create an [app](https://pushover.net/apps/build) to get this token.

To test this, you will need to register a device with pushover. This can be a Desktop, an Android device or a Mac. You can find the instructions [here](https://pushover.net/clients).

Once you have registered the device, you can run the test. Upon success, you will receive a notification on the device(s).
